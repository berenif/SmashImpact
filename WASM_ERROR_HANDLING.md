# WASM Error Handling Documentation

## Problem
The error `SES_UNCAUGHT_EXCEPTION: TypeError: Game.engine.checkCollisions is not a function` occurs when the WebAssembly (WASM) game engine fails to load properly but the game still tries to call its methods.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Method Existence Checks
Before calling any `Game.engine` methods, we now check if they exist:

```javascript
// Check collisions - only if method exists
if (Game.engine.checkCollisions) {
    Game.engine.checkCollisions();
}

// Get entity count - only if method exists
const entities = Game.engine.getAllEntities ? Game.engine.getAllEntities() : [];
```

### 2. Improved WASM Failure Handling
When WASM fails to load:
- A clear error message is displayed to the player
- The game is prevented from starting (using `Game.initialized = false`)
- Players are given troubleshooting steps and a retry button

### 3. No JavaScript Fallback
As per requirements, there is **NO JavaScript fallback implementation**. The game requires WASM to run. If WASM fails:
- The game stops completely
- An error message is shown
- The player must resolve the issue and reload

## Key Files Modified
- `game.html` - Main game file with WASM loading and error handling

## Common WASM Loading Issues
1. **Browser Compatibility**: Some older browsers don't support WebAssembly
2. **Security Policies**: Corporate networks or browser extensions may block WASM
3. **Corrupted Files**: The .wasm file may be corrupted or missing
4. **Server Configuration**: The server must serve .wasm files with correct MIME type
5. **Cache Issues**: Browser cache may contain corrupted WASM module

## For Future Agents
When encountering WASM-related errors:
1. First check if `Game.engine` exists before calling its methods
2. Ensure `Game.initialized` is true before running game logic
3. Do NOT create JavaScript fallback implementations
4. Focus on helping users troubleshoot WASM loading issues instead

## Testing WASM Failure
To test the error handling:
1. Block WebAssembly in browser settings
2. Delete or rename the `game_engine.wasm` file
3. Introduce syntax errors in the WASM module loading code
