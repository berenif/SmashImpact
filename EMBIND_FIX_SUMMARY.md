# Embind Linking Issue Fix Summary

## Problem
The GitHub Actions workflow was failing with undefined symbol errors for embind functions:
- `_embind_register_class`
- `_embind_register_class_constructor`
- `_embind_register_class_property`
- `_embind_register_class_function`

## Root Cause
The `wolf_ai_wasm.cpp` file uses Emscripten's embind feature (includes `<emscripten/bind.h>` and uses `EMSCRIPTEN_BINDINGS` macro), but the GitHub Actions workflow was not compiling with the required `--bind` flag.

Additionally, the `build_wolf_ai.sh` script was incorrectly using both `-lembind` and `--bind` flags together, which can cause linking issues.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/wasm-build.yml`)
Added the `--bind` flag to the em++ compilation command in the "Build Wolf AI WASM module" step:
```bash
em++ wolf_ai_wasm.cpp \
  ... other flags ...
  --bind \
  -o wasm/wolf_ai.js
```

### 2. Fixed build_wolf_ai.sh Script
Removed the redundant `-lembind` flag and kept only `--bind`:
```bash
emcc wolf_ai_wasm.cpp \
  ... other flags ...
  --bind \  # Removed -lembind, kept only --bind
  -o public/wolf_ai.js
```

## Key Points
- When using Emscripten's embind feature, you only need the `--bind` flag
- The `-lembind` flag is redundant and can cause linking issues
- The `--bind` flag automatically links the necessary embind library
- All other build scripts in the project were already correctly using only `--bind`

## Next Steps
The GitHub Actions workflow should now build successfully. The embind symbols will be properly linked when the `--bind` flag is used during compilation.
