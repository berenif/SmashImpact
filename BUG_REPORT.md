# Bug Report - Smash Impact Game

## Executive Summary
This document outlines all bugs found in the Smash Impact isometric game codebase, categorized by severity from critical to low priority. All critical bugs have been fixed to prevent game crashes and improve stability.

## Critical Bugs (FIXED)

### 1. Array Bounds Checking Issues
**Location**: Multiple functions in `isometric-game.js`
**Description**: Array access without bounds checking could cause crashes when accessing grid coordinates
**Impact**: Game crashes when accessing invalid array indices
**Fix**: Added comprehensive bounds checking in:
- `checkCollision()` function
- `carveRoom()` function  
- `createPath()` function
- `generateLevel()` function

### 2. Null Reference Access
**Location**: Enemy update functions, projectile collision detection
**Description**: Accessing properties on potentially null objects
**Impact**: Game crashes when enemies or projectiles try to access invalid player data
**Fix**: Added null checks and type validation before accessing object properties

### 3. Missing Error Handling in Critical Functions
**Location**: `init()`, `gameLoop()`, event handlers
**Description**: Critical game functions lacked proper error handling
**Impact**: Game could crash silently on initialization or during gameplay
**Fix**: Added try-catch blocks and validation checks

### 4. Canvas Context Validation
**Location**: Canvas initialization and rendering functions
**Description**: Canvas operations without proper validation
**Impact**: Game crashes when canvas element is not found or context is invalid
**Fix**: Added canvas and context validation before operations

### 5. Game State Initialization Issues
**Location**: `init()` function
**Description**: Game state not properly initialized, leading to undefined property access
**Impact**: Game crashes on startup due to missing game state
**Fix**: Added proper game state initialization with fallbacks

## High Priority Bugs (Identified)

### 1. Collision Detection Edge Cases
**Location**: Collision detection functions
**Description**: Potential division by zero and boundary issues in collision calculations
**Impact**: Game physics could behave unexpectedly
**Status**: Identified, needs further investigation

### 2. Memory Leaks
**Location**: Event listeners and intervals
**Description**: Event listeners and intervals not properly cleaned up
**Impact**: Memory usage increases over time, potential performance degradation
**Status**: Identified, needs cleanup implementation

### 3. Race Conditions
**Location**: Async operations in multiplayer and game updates
**Description**: Async operations without proper synchronization
**Impact**: Game state inconsistencies, multiplayer desync
**Status**: Identified, needs synchronization implementation

## Medium Priority Bugs (Identified)

### 1. Input Validation
**Location**: Input handling functions
**Description**: Missing validation for user inputs
**Impact**: Potential security issues, unexpected behavior
**Status**: Identified, needs input sanitization

### 2. Performance Issues
**Location**: Game loop and rendering functions
**Description**: Inefficient loops and rendering operations
**Impact**: Frame rate drops, poor performance on lower-end devices
**Status**: Identified, needs optimization

## Low Priority Bugs (Identified)

### 1. Code Style Issues
**Location**: Throughout codebase
**Description**: Minor formatting and consistency issues
**Impact**: Code maintainability, readability
**Status**: Identified, cosmetic improvements needed
