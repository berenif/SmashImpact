# Sprite Sheets

Binary sprite sheets are not stored in the repository. Download the archive below and extract the PNG files into this directory:

https://github.com/OurProjectAssets/smashimpact-sprites/releases/download/v1.0/sprite-sheets.zip

The archive should provide the following files:

- `character-idle.png`
- `character-move.png`
- `character-attack.png`

Each sprite sheet contains frames arranged horizontally with consistent frame dimensions.
